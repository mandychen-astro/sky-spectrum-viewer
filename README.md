# sky-spectrum-viewer
View high resolution (R~32000--45000) sky spectrum from UVEX (3140--10430A, Hanuschik 2003) and GIANO (9700--18000A, Oliva+2015).

Links to these two papers are:
Hanuschik 2003: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...407.1157H/abstract
Oliva+2015: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...581A..47O/abstract

In the overlapping region of 9700-10430A, the sky line fluxes from GIANO data are lower than the fluxes from UVEX.  My guess is that this is due to line strength variations (might be temporal or spatial or both).
